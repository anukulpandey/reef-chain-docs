## What is Reef's mission?
Reef's mission is to make DeFi, NFTs and games easy and accessible to more people.

## What is REEF token?
REEF coin is the native currency on Reef Chain, and is used for transaction fees (gas) and on-chain goverance (NPoS and PoC). REEF coin is also available as ERC-20 on Ethereum and BSC and are convertible 1:1 with native Reef Chain tokens.

## Is Reef Chain PoW?
Reef Chain is **not** incumbered by Proof of Work (PoW). Furthermore, smart contract transaction **fees get burned** to align scalability incentives - validators only get paid from a fixed rewards pool and have no incentive to artificially constrain the network like in Bitcoin or other PoW networks.
