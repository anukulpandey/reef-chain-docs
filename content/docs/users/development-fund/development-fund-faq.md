## For Stakers

### Q: What is staking?

Staking means *voting* for or *nominating* a validator to receive rewards.

In order to be eligible for the rewards set out, a user's stake on the Community Development Fund (CDF) validator must be equal to or greater than **1 million REEF**.

### Q: How do I participate in the CDF?

You can stake your tokens with the CDF validator on [Reef Console](https://console.reefscan.com) or [Fearless Wallet](https://fearlesswallet.io).

The interface allows you to track how many tokens you have available to stake, your validators, accumulated rewards, current era, and more. You can lock, unlock, stake, unstake and move your tokens between validators directly on the Portal.

### Q: What does locking the tokens mean?

Locking up funds essentially means “setting them aside” so they can be used for staking.

This is just a “status” of your REEF tokens at the blockchain level. **There's no need for any separate actions to lock your tokens;** it's done automatically when you stake with the Community Development Fund validator.

Please notice, that locked funds **NEVER** leave the staker's wallet - it simply makes it impossible to use those funds for fee payments or transferring them until you unlock/unstake them.

### Q: Does locking bring rewards?

**❗ Locking brings rewards as long as you are one of the top 64 nominators on your selected validator.**

Your tokens remain **locked** but will not earn rewards if your stake is not one of the largest 64 stakes with your selected validator.

### Q: How do I unstake/unlock my tokens?

You can unstake tokens at any time without a specific process, but **unstaking during an era excludes those tokens from that era's reward calculation**.

Unstaking reduces the staked amount immediately for both the current and next eras. Similar to staking, you must claim all unclaimed rewards before you can unstake.

### Q: How do I unlock my tokens?

You can unlock your tokens whenever you choose. Unlocking your tokens also automatically unstakes them from any validator they are bonded/staked to, so there is no need for a separate unstaking action.

The tokens will have to go through the unlocking process that will be initiated *automatically*. This is a common mechanism to mitigate selling pressure.

**There's no need for any separate actions to initiate the unlocking of your tokens.**

Once unlocking is complete, after 28 eras, these tokens are placed in your Available Balance.

### Q: When will I start getting rewards after I stake?

If you stake during an era, your stake will come into effect during the next era. If your stake is one of the 64 largest on your validator, you will earn rewards for that era.

### Q: When can I claim my rewards?

Your inflation rewards are added to your stake, increasing the bond and earning more REEF, or to a wallet you designate at time of staking. The choice is yours.

## For Developers

### Q: How can I participate?

We will create an open bidding process for the Community Development Fund in Q4 2024. Until then, we are welcome to developers joining the [Discord](https://discord.gg/reefchain) or [Telegram](https://t.me/reefchain) communities and sharing some information about what they would like to build. A community manager will direct you on what to do next.
